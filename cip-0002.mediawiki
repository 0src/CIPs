==Abstract==

This CIP proposes a block size growth intended to to be better able to cope with varying transactional load on the Burst blockchain and other technological improvements for the foreseeable future.

==Motivation==
In order to ensure that miner earnings will nominally remain the same after linear-progressive fee proposed in the Dymaxion Whitepaper, the maximum number of transaction must be 1020.  “Nominally” meaning same network load, same price. Moreover, under high-load conditions miner profit would be a multiple of what it is now.

==Specification==

===Compatibility===
This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread consensus.

===Memory-Related Parameters===

# maximum number of transactions
