[CIP10](cip-0010.mediawiki)

==Abstract==

BURST shall provide a favourable transaction fee irrespective of its
performance.  A favourable price here is less than one USD-cent per
payment/multi-out.

==Motivation==

With implementation of the CIP10 it will be possible for the chain to
determine the value of BURST in USD and to set the cheapest slot Tx
fee to one USD-cent.

This guarantees that BURST payments will be unrivalled in terms of
price, regardless of the value development of BURST payments, which
will enable BURST to establish itself as a global payment network.

==Specification==

With introduction of CIP10 we could automated calculate the current
maximal min-fee in relation to the BURST USD value.

So at the moment we have a fee of 0.00735 BURST (FEE_QUANT) which is
less than one USD-cent.

The chain would calculate from the last 360 blocks (= 1 day), the
average exchange-rate BURST/USD.

If 0.00735 BURST would be more value than one USD-cent we should
adjust the min fee to the equivalent of max one USD-cent. With a
RWFDS, the wallet could do so automatically.

    if (trade-rate * 0.01 < 0.00735 BURST)
    then FEE_QUANT = round(trade-rate * 0.01)

FEE_QUANT can be rounded to a 8 decimal places precision
