==Abstract==

Currently, wallets poll their peers for unconfirmed transactions (UT)
every 5 seconds. During each such poll they get all the UTs currently
in mempool, which means that until a block is forged (240s on
average), every UT in mempool can be potentially sent more than 20
times over and over again. Clearly this can cause a network load and
could be mitigated with a more intelligent approach of sending UTs.

In a differential UT propagation, for every UT received each node
attaches a time stamp to this UT with the "node time" it received
this. When the node is asked by a peer to send unconfirmed
transactions without such a time stamp, it sends all UTs in mempool
and the time stamp of the newest UT of this package. THe peer can
remember this time stamp and next time it polls for UTs, it can send
this time stamp with the request and gets only new UTs that arrived
after this time.
