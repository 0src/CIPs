## Abstract

Burst is divisible by 8 digits, so the smallest unit of account for
Burst - called a Planck - is 1/100 000 000th of a Burst. It is
certainly possible - right now - to send 1 Planck to any address.

The current minimum FEE_QUANT (the smallest fee you can use to make a
transaction) is 735 000 Planck. It is conceivable that in future where
Burst has a much higher value, this fee might be lowered.

There are a few applications where sending 1 Planck seems
reasonable. One could "burn Burst" by sending 1 Planck to random
addresses via Multi-Out Same. Retrieving these would always be
non-economical.

Currently such a transaction would send 128 Planck and cost at least
735 000 Planck. Only the 128 Planck could be considered "burnt", while
the FEE_QUANT would go straight to miner reward and therefore remain
in the economic cycle of Burst.

Addresses containing a balance less than FEE_QUANT should
be considered "Balance Dust".

A payment transaction of any type (as of now Ordinary Payments,
Multi-Outs and Subscriptions) should be considered "Transaction Dust"
if the result of this transaction would lead to a target address
containing "Balance Dust".

## Motivation

Depending on the context, but effectively for every type of
transaction, there is a threshold below which the sums are
economically irrelevant. This does result in rounding to the Nth
digit, truncating or similar approximations.

As of today, FEE_QUANT is around 0.00735 US-cent and even with a Burst
reaching parity with the USD, FEE_QUANT would still be below 1
US-cent. This threshold is for the foreseeable future low enough to
not cause economic damage when rounding to it or considering only
amounts higher than this.

Coupling the informal term "dust" to FEE_QUANT, protects small balance
accounts even in the case Burst should rise significantly in
value. FEE_QUANT would have to be lowered then to keep transaction
cost economically feasible.

## Specification

As this CIP is an informal proposal, the Burst protocol will further
*allow* to make transactions whose economic impact is below
FEE_QUANT. However, if this CIP is accepted, it shall not be
considered a bug if a software or process does not.

The following rules shall apply on-chain:

1) avoiding a transaction to move amounts smaller than FEE_QUANT is
   considered good practice

2) the recipient of a transaction as defined in 1) has no authority to
   demand such a transaction

3) avoiding a transaction that would result in a balance on the target
   adress smaller than FEE_QUANT is considered good practice

4) the recipient of a transaction as defined in 3) has no authority to
   demand such a transaction

Limiting these rules on-chain means that any amount below FEE_QUANT in
internal accounting systems (pending pool fees, exchange fees, etc.)
may still be perfectly relevant.

This CIP does not forbid any transaction to happen. It merely defines
which transactions are sufficiently "economically irrelevant", so the
sender can decide to not perform them - and the receiver has to
respect this decision.

### Examples

Sender A could send recipient B a total of 0.001 Burst (asset
dividends, pool payout, ...), but won't as it is below FEE_QUANT. B
has no right to demand this sum to be sent to him.

Recipient B has 0.005 Burst on his address. Sender A could send
recipient B a total of 0.001 Burst, but won't because the resulting
balance (0.006 Burst) is smaller than FEE_QUANT. Recipient B has no
right to demand this sum to be sent to him.transaction to happen.

Person C has a Burst address with the balance of FEE_QUANT + 1
Planck. It is perfectly reasonable for that person to issue a
transaction costing FEE_QUANT tx fee to "save" that 1 Planck to some
other address of theirs. As C is in the role of sender (and maybe even
receiver), it's upon them to decide if this transaction shall happen
or not.

## Discussion

This informal CIP defines a boundary of economic relevance. This is
not a novel concept. BTC also knows the notion of "Dust" and for any
rational participant in the Burst transaction network, moving funds
that are smaller than the minimum tx fee necessary to move them is out
of the question.

Neither does this CIP nor will the wallet forbid anyone to perform
economically unfeasible transactions. You - as a sender - will always
have the right to decide to make these transactions. Contrary to BTC,
where a transaction with an output value lower than 5460 satoshi gets
rejected with the message "TX rejected (code -22)", this is a much
more liberal aproach.

Recipients are also protected by the binding of the term dust to
FEE_QUANT. In case Burst should raise in value significantly,
FEE_QUANT has to be lowered, as transaction cost would become
exorbitant (With Burst at $100, the current FEE_QUANT would be $0.735)
