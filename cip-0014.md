## Abstract

[QR codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) with [deeplinks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking) enable users to scan a QR code,
and be automatically led into a specific screen of an application of a mobile
device. This deeplink is similar to a hyperlink we know from webpages.
It contains a protocol refering to the application specified, and it can encode
extra information on which screen it needs to lead to. This enables
a very interactive experience using these QR codes, to improve
the user experience of Burst.

## Motivation

One of the main goals of Burst is to be a monetary unit that's easily exchanged
between different users. It is to be expected that most person-to-person
Burst transactions will happen in stores. A client purchases an amount of items,
and wishes to pay for it with Burst.

To facilitate this better, a Point of Sales (PoS) software should exist for
the store to use, itemizing the different purchases, and adding them together
to the sum that has to be paid by the client. After this, a QR code can be
generated, which the client has to scan with their QR scanner, to lead them
to the "payment" screen in their Burst mobile application. This screen will have
a number of predefined values for the amount of Burst that has to be paid,
the suggested fee, and an extra message (to link the transaction back to the
internal DB of the PoS software), all defined by the PoS software.

As not all payments will happen in stores, an another use case is when
one user wants to pay another one. Generating a QR code can improve
the user experience of conducting such a transaction. Instead of requiring
the sender to type in the recipient's Burst address, the recipient
QR code can be scanned, and the remaining fields filled manually.

The capability improvement is not limited to usage in situations where
the sender and the recipient are in the same location. Recipient QR codes
can be published in various locations: e.g. an artist publishes their QR code
next to a piece of art they created - enabling art lovers to give
a donation by scanning the  QR code as decsribed above.

## Specification

### Wallet internals
To facilitate the QR code generation, a new dependency is added to the [Zebra Crossing](https://github.com/zxing|ZXing) library,
falling under the [Apache License v2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html).

The deeplink will be built up with the values specified through the wallet API,
and currently only supports a request for Burst. In case new possible actions
are found to be useful, this protocol can be extended.

The request for Burst deeplink looks like one of the following patterns:

burst://requestBurst&receiver=[RECEIVER]&amountNQT=[AMOUNTNQT]&feeNQT=[FEENQT]&message=[MESSAGE]&immutable=[ISIMMUTABLE]
burst://requestBurst&receiver=[RECEIVER]&amountNQT=[AMOUNTNQT]&feeSuggestionType=[FEESUGGESTIONTYPE]&message=[MESSAGE]&immutable=[ISIMMUTABLE]

The meanings of these fields are the following:

* [RECEIVER]: Address that should receive the Burst
* [AMOUNTNQT]: Amount of Burst that should be sent
* [FEENQT]: An exact amount of Burst that should be used as the fee value
* [FEESUGGESTIONTYPE]: A [CIP13 suggested transaction fee type](cip-0013.mediawiki)
* [MESSAGE]: An extra message that can be passed along
* [ISIMMUTABLE]: A boolean field deciding whether the requested transaction should be immutable

In both cases the recipient field is always required. The remaining fields,
apart from the message field are required in case [ISIMMUTABLE] is true.

[FEESUGGESTIONTYPE] and [FEENQT] are mutually exclusive. In case both values
are given, a preference should be given for [FEENQT].

Additionally, an overlay with the Burst logo will be added to the generated QR code,
to make it clear it's for Burst.

### HTTP API
The wallet's HTTP API offers a "generateDeepLink" action, which takes
the arguments passed into the resulting deeplink as its arguments.

### Mobile wallet
After scanning the QR code, the engrained deeplink enables opening
the mobile wallet to a specified screen.

In case all the required values are specified, this screen can lead to
the payment screen which displays the payment values like recipient,
amount to pay, either exact fee or suggested fee type, and an additional message.

Otherwise it will lead to a screen that will enable missing values to be filled in.

It's also possible for the requester to use a flag that will define whether
the values are immutable or not - in case they're immutable, they can't be changed
anymore by the Burst sender in the transaction.

### Point of Sales Systems
Point of Sales Systems should do a HTTP call to their local BRS
to generate their required QR code. It is recommended to use at least a
standard or priority transaction fee. It is also recommended to pass along
a message that enables linking the resulting transaction to somewhere in
the Point of Sales System's database, to close up this information loop.
