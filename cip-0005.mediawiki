==Abstract==

POC 2 format plots is consisting of interleaved SHABAL256 hashes and
it will prevent time-memory tradeoff for high-range scoops.

==Motivation==

Now with the current PoC used with Burstcoin, there indeed are
time-memory tradeoffs possible.  This attack on PoC mining fairness
was possible in theory, but not feasible economically, because the PoW
required for this mode of operation consumed far more energy than a
PoC mining style.

However recent advancements in hardware and GPU performance do show,
that economical feasibility is just a matter of time.

==Specification==

===Compatibility===

This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old
fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread
consensus.
