==Abstract==

There is a scalability issue with blockchains in general and it
becomes increasingly more difficult to have efficient faucets or
efficient way to issue a transaction and serve several people at once.

==Motivation==

With combination of dynamic transaction fees and multi-out + multi-out
same transactions, the maximum transaction per second (a.k.a "tps")
Burst will able to achieve has jumped from 1 tps to 80 tps.

==Specification==

===Compatibility===

This is a hard forking change, thus breaks compatibility with old
fully-validating node. It should not be deployed without widespread
consensus.

===Memory-Related Parameters===

# maximum multi out recipients
# maximum multi same out recipients
