==Abstract==

The ability to issue many transactions wit a "too low" fee can cause
some strain on unconfirmed transaction (UT) handling and UT
propagation. While the current wallets can cope with it, there is
still room for improvement. It is possible to estimate which UT has a
chance at all to be included in a block and which hasn't. Purging UTs
that have no chance of being included will lower forging load as well
as network communication load.
